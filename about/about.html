  <h3 id="dao">DAO Governance (2025)</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>The ASA Stats DAO is live, with core infrastructure and treasury now operating under a limited-governor model.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Current State</h4>
    <p>
    &#8226; DAO governance was established through long-term staking of ≥500,000 ASASTATS over 10 months.<br>
    &#8226; The initial governor cohort is fixed; no new seats are currently being added.<br>
    &#8226; DAO privileges are active via on-chain smart contracts (Permission, Subtopia).<br>
    &#8226; On-chain proposal voting is in development and planned for release in a future update.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Why Access Is Limited</h4>
    <p>“The DAO is intended to remain stable. New seats will be added only under specific proposals, voted on by existing governors. Membership is intentionally exclusive, transparent, and locked unless expanded through formal on-chain governance.” — <a href="https://medium.com/@asastats/dao-subscription-and-governance-staking-updates-c2d3244f4c03" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read the full article on Medium">ASA Stats Medium: New DAO Seat Model</a>

  <h3 id="principles">Infrastructure & Design Principles</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>
    &#8226; Near real-time block sync<br>
    &#8226; Direct-chain data reads (not reliant on third-party APIs)<br>
    &#8226; Planned custom Kubernetes scaling for high uptime and user traffic surges<br>
    <br>
    Everything shown in the platform’s UI is powered by the same API available to developers and advanced users.

  <h3 id="team">Team & Funding</h3>

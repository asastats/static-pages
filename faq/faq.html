        <p><strong>How does ASA Stats governance work, and what role do token holders play in decision-making processes?</strong>
        <br><br>The ASA Stats Team will be in charge of developing an Algorand Smart Contract and its deployment on Mainnet (Permission ASC). Every DAO governor seat's address will be hard-coded into the Permission ASC together with the seat's number of votes. The ASA Stats Engine will respect and evaluate the amount of governance seat votes.

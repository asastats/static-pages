  <div class="col s12">
    <p>ASA Stats Token is created with the following immutable properties:<br>
    <br>
    Name: <a href="https://allo.info/asset/393537671" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit ASASTATS Allo page">ASA Stats Token</a><br>
    ID: 393537671<br>
    Unit name: ASASTATS<br>
    Total supply: 1,000,000,000<br>
    Decimals: 6<br>
    URL: <a href="https://www.asastats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Token URL field">https://www.asastats.com</a><br>
    <br>
    Clawback and freeze addresses are not set.
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <h4>Token allocation</h4>
   <div class="col s12">
      <p>
      <strong>1) Development Pool (20%): </strong>A total of 200,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated for funding the development of ASA Stats in the pre-DAO phase.<br>
      <strong>2) Administration and Costs (12%): </strong>A total of 120,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated for the establishment and administration of the legal entity behind ASA Stats during the pre-DAO phase.<br>
      <strong>3) Team Rewards (12%): </strong>A total of 120,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated for Team rewards. ASA Stats Team received their full rewards, in 24 monthly batches of 5,000,000 ASASTATS since inception.<br>
      <strong>4) Community Rewards (15%): </strong>A total of 150,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated to the community members for rewarding their contribution to the ASA Stats project. Such activities include channel administration, feature requests and bug reports.<br>
      <strong>5) Airdrops (8%): </strong>A total of 80,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated for rewarding community contributions or other activities that are not easily measurable – if they are measurable then pool 4 is used instead.<br>
      <strong>6) Giveaways (2%): </strong>A total of 20,000,000 ASASTATS has been allocated for ecosystem development, attracting potential users.<br>
      <strong>7) DAO Treasury: </strong> The rest of the supply. ASASTATS tokens from pools 1, 2, 5, and 6 that have not been spent in the pre-DAO phase will be transferred to this pool upon the establishment of the ASA Stats DAO.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The term “allocation” refers both to tokens that are actually allocated to a pool-specific wallet, as well as tokens that are defined as a percentage but not already transferred to the related wallet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>ASASTATS received by charging for professional services will be reallocated to the pools defined. A prioritization in reallocating will take place based on the pools' current needs and their states related to initial allocation.<br>
      </p>
      <br>

  <h4 id="reports">ASA Stats Transparency Reports</h4>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>Every transfer in and out of any pool in the pre-DAO phase is conducted by the Team and listed in the Team's monthly financial/transparency reports.<br>
